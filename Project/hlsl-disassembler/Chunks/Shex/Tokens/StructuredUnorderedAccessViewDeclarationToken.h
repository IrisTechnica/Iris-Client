	/// [23:23] D3D11_SB_UAV_HAS_ORDER_PRESERVING_COUNTER or 0
	///
	///            The presence of this flag means that if a UAV is bound to the
	///            corresponding slot, it must have been created with 
	///            D3D11_BUFFER_UAV_FLAG_COUNTER at the API.  Also, the shader
	///            can contain either imm_atomic_alloc or _consume instructions
	///            operating on the given UAV.
	/// 
	///            If this flag is not present, the shader can still contain
	///            either imm_atomic_alloc or imm_atomic_consume instructions for
	///            this UAV.  But if such instructions are present in this case,
	///            and a UAV is bound corresponding slot, it must have been created 
	///            with the D3D11_BUFFER_UAV_FLAG_APPEND flag at the API.
	///            Append buffers have a counter as well, but values returned 
	///            to the shader are only valid for the lifetime of the shader 
	///            invocation.

	///         extended.

	///     being declared.
	/// (2) a DWORD indicating UINT32 byte stride
